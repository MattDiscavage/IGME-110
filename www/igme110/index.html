    <h1>Matthew Discavage: A Short Bio</h1>

    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Matthew Discavage, and I am a current first-year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I graduated last year
    from Gates Chili High School, and I am majoring in Game Design & Development. While this major focuses on coding and software development, I also have
    a musical background. I have been singing and playing clarinet since 4th grade, and I have also been composing musical works occasionally since summer
    2016. As a matter of fact, my ideal career is to become a video game composer, combining both my passions for games and music, but a non-musical job as
    a game developer would be just as rewarding. At the current moment, I have not found an opportunity to organize my compositions together into a
    portfolio, but a youtube video of the first piece I ever composed can be found on a friend's channel
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZTgAF05IA0" title="Legendary Pokemon Battle (original fan-made piece)" target="_blank">here</a> (the nickname
    I was credited with is my old Youtube username for the sake of anonymity; it has since been changed).</p>

    <p>As mentioned, games and music are my two main interests. When it comes to games, I'm mainly a Nintendo fan, with <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and
    <em>Pokemon</em> being my favorite franchises. I have lately been playing <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> quite a bit, and I have spent weeks designing a
    series of traditional levels that wouldn't look out of place in an actual Mario game (they are sorted into 8 worlds of 8 levels, and the entirety of
    World 1 is currently uploaded). On the music side of things, I am currently a part of one of RIT's acapella groups,
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RITSurroundSound" title="RIT Surround Sound Facebook Page" target="_blank">Surround Sound</a>. I also like playing
    Dungeons & Dragons with my friends occasionally, though I have not found the time to do so since joining college. If anyone reading this is a fan of
    D&D, please let me know!</p>
