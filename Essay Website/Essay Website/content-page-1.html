    <h2>Technological Innovations</h2>

    <p>Nintendo has always been known for being innovative when it comes to both software and hardware. From popularizing shoulder buttons and thumbsticks to single-handedly reviving the video game industry
        with a game featuring a plumber facing off against a giant fire-breathing turtle, they've no doubt contributed <em>very</em> significantly to the gaming world.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most surprising hardware idea they came up with was the Wii, which introduced motion controls. People laughed it off and thought Nintendo was doomed to fail, but it turned out to be a <em>massive</em>
        success. They've since had even greater success with the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console that allows the player to switch between playing on a TV and using it as a handheld whenever they wish.
        It has since surpassed the Wii as the fastest-selling console in video game history.</p>
    <p>In terms of software, games like the aforementioned <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (the one with the plumber and turtle) ended up codifying the platformer genre, and Nintendo has had similar success with franchises such       as <em>Pokemon</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>.</p>
