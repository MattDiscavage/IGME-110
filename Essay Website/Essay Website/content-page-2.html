    <h2>Social Unifications</h2>

    <p>Technological innovation isn't the only thing Nintendo is known for. Their Wii console was revolutionary with its motion controls, but it also exapnded the gaming world in a way that had never been done before.
        The simplicity of the controls allowed non-gamers to experience casual games such as Wii Sports, and video games became family events for many people. Even senior citizens got in on the fun.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most important thing Nintendo is known for is making games that are simply fun for people to play. The Wii was far from the only thing helping to accomplish this. People have been able to share the             experience of enjoying video games across many different console generations, and this enjoyment unifies people across the world. Nintendo has contributed heavily to this phenomenon, and the late, great Satoru           Iwata, former global president and CEO of Nintendo, is known for his speech where he famously stated that "Even if we come from different sides of the world... every one of us here today is identical in the most         important way: each one of us has the heart of a gamer."
